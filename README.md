## Instructions

**Step 1**: Make sure that [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. I suggest using a node version manager.  
  * [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) -- Mac or Linux.
  * [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) -- Windows.

**Step 2**: Install global dependencies. Execute these commands anywhere in the command line
  * [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) -- Module bundler

```shell
$ npm install -g webpack
```
**Step 3**: Install project dependencies.

```shell
$ npm install
```
**Step 4**: Start the dev server

```shell
$ npm start
```

**Tests**: Run the tests once or continuously.
```shell
$ npm test
$ npm run test:watch
```
